# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Capstone project: Analyzing Starbuck's data

## Overview
This project is the capstone project of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.
In this project, I explore the given datasets and try to find useful insights about the offer type preferances of the different demographic groups. 

## Useful Resources
These datasets were provided through Udacity. Because of the sensitivity of the data I didn't dowload them.
- portfolio.json — containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- profile.json — demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json — records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed


## Summary
In this post I gave a detailed description about my work: https://medium.com/@csokaboglarka95/which-demographic-groups-to-target-with-different-offers-as-a-coffee-company-d21e278f884e

I had a look at a coffee company’s customer data. I tried to figure out the best offer options for the different demographic groups.

It turned out that the best tactic is to send discount offers to people from the age group 2 ( between 49–66 years). Their completed/received ratio is between 50–80% which I think is relatively high. Overall we can state the female and other genders have higher chance to fulfill an offer.


## Future work
- Give a more detailed analysis including the informational offers and the different types inside the discount, bogo offers.
- Try to get insights from transaction data as well.
- Predict if a costumer will respond to a given offer or not (more individualistic approach).
